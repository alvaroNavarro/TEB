# For me (Christoph), x11 (xquartz) was not working if gnuplot was called from default terminal.
# It worked only in xterm. Since xcode starts the default terminal, I decided to try aquaterm.

# install xcode with command line tools
# install homebrew
# install aquaterm
# terminal: brew install gnuplot --with-aquaterm
# test installation:
# terminal: gnuplot
#			plot x
