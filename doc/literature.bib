 abstract = {This paper is concerned with the planning of optimal trajectories for vehicle collision avoidance with a Timed Elastic Band (TEB) framework. The avoidance trajectory is represented by a TEB which is optimized with respect to multiple partially conflicting objectives. The resulting trajectory constitutes the optimal compromise between a mere braking and a lane change maneuver that avoids the collision with the smoothest feasible path. The approach is applicable to general critical trac situations as the TEB considers the constraints imposed by the vehicle dynamics, road boundaries, static obstacles and moving vehicles.},

 abstract = {Many popular problems in robotics and computer vision including various types of simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) or bundle adjustment (BA) can be phrased as least squares optimization of an error function that can be represented by a graph. This paper describes the general structure of such problems and presents g2o, an open-source C++ framework for optimizing graph-based nonlinear error functions. Our system has been designed to be easily extensible to a wide range of problems and a new problem typically can be specified in a few lines of code. The current implementation provides solutions to several variants of SLAM and BA. We provide evaluations on a wide range of real-world and simulated datasets. The results demonstrate that while being general g2o offers a performance comparable to implementations of state of-the-art approaches for the specific problems.},

 abstract = {The classic {\dq}elastic band{\dq} deforms a path generated by a global planner with respect to the shortest path length while avoiding contact with obstacles. It does not take any dynamic constraints of the underlying robot into account directly. This contribution introduces a new approach called {\dq}timed elastic band{\dq} which explicitly considers temporal aspects of the motion in terms of dynamic constraints such as limited robot velocities and accelerations. The {\dq}timed elastic band{\dq} problem is formulated in a weighted multi-objective optimization framework. Most objectives are local as they depend on a few neighboring intermediate configurations. This results in a sparse system matrix for which efficient large-scale constrained least squares optimization methods exist. Results from simulations and experiments with a real robot demonstrate that the approach is robust and computationally efficient to generate optimal robot trajectories in real time. The {\dq}timed elastic band{\dq} converts an initial path composed of a sequence of way points into a trajectory with explicit dependence on time which enables the control of the robot in real time. Due to its modular formulation the approach is easily extended to incorporate additional objectives and constraints.},

 abstract = {The ``timed elastic band'' approach optimizes robot trajectories by subsequent modification of an initial trajectory generated by a global planner. The objectives considered in the trajectory optimization include but are not limited to the overall path length, trajectory execution time, separation from obstacles, passing through intermediate way points and compliance with the robots dynamic, kinematic and geometric constraints. ``Timed elastic bands'' explicitly consider spatial-temporal aspects of the motion in terms of dynamic constraints such as limited robot velocities and accelerations. The trajectory planning operates in real time such that ``timed elastic bands'' cope with dynamic obstacles and motion constraints. The ``timed elastic band problem'' is formulated as a scalarized multi-objective optimization problem. Most objectives are local and relate to only a small subset of parameters as they only depend on a few consecutive robot states. This local structure results in a sparse system matrix, which allows the utilization of fast and efficient optimization techniques such as the open-source framework ``g2o'' for solving ``timed elastic band'' problems. The ``g2o'' sparse system solvers have been successfully applied to VSLAM problems. This contribution describes the application and adaptation of the g2o-framework in the context of trajectory modification with the ``timed elastic band''. Results from simulations and experiments with a real robot demonstrate that the implementation is robust and computationally efficient.},
