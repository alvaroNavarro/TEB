 * @brief Extended base solver class for least squares optimizations.
 *
 * @ingroup solver
 *
 * This abstract class extends the BaseSolver class by routines and methods
 * required by dedicated least squares solvers. \n
 * It transforms inequality and equality constraints into soft constraints 
 * that are added to the objective functions.
 * objective functions are squared. \n
 * The jacobian calculation is based on the new transformed objective function
 * and used for quasi-newton hessian approximation \f$ \mathbf{H} = \mathbf{J}^T \mathbf{J} \f$.
 * However, the actual hessian calculation using the computeHessian() functions of each edge
 * is ommitted.
